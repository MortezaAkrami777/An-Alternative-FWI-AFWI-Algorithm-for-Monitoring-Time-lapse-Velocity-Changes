## AFWI Codes in Python
This repository contains a set of complete Python code for AFWI algorithm based on [Di Yang's PhD thesis](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/95558?show=full). We tried to reproduce the experiment which Di Yang performed in the chapter IV of his thesis. We used [PySIT package](http://pysit.org/).
