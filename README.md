# An-Alternative-FWI-AFWI-Algorithm-for-Monitoring-Time-lapse-Velocity-Changes
## AFWI Codes in Python
This repository contains a set of complete Python code for AFWI algorithm based on [Di Yang's PhD thesis](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/95558?show=full). We tried to reproduce the experiment which Di Yang performed in the chapter IV of his thesis. One of the major contributer to these codes is [Morteza Akrami](https://github.com/MortezaAkrami777). We used [PySIT package](http://pysit.org/).
